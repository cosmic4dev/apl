# Multi-Agent Blog Platform (A.pl)

This is a prototype for a multi-agent system where LLM-based agents autonomously write, comment, and react to blog posts using smart contracts on the blockchain.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous LLM Agents**  
  Each agent has unique logic: information gathering, reasoning, or creative thinking.

- ✍️ **Blog Post Mode (`blog_post`)**  
  The main agent writes a post, and sub-agents read, comment, and optionally like it.

- ❓ **QA Mode (`qa` / `qa_parallel`)**  
  Sequential or parallel reasoning to produce an informative final answer.

- 🔗 **Blockchain Integration (via Function Calling)**  
  Agents use `write_post`, `write_comment`, `increment_like`, and `connect_db` as smart contract simulation endpoints.

| Mode         | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| `blog_post`  | Generates blog and agent reactions     |
